# International Space Station Live
This project was created as a ReactJS practice. It shows current location of ISS (International Space Station) in real time and updates every 5 seconds. It also displays a map using LeafletJS library and displays above which country ISS currently is by fetching country name from LocationIQ API using the latitude and longitude coordinates provided by WhereTheISSAt API.
